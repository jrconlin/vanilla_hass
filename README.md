# THIS IS PRE-BETA SOFTWARE. 

This most definitely a work in progress. I make lots of shortcuts and things are definitely not done yet.

A HomeAssistant dashboard written in vanilla JS, CSS &amp; HTML

## Why?

HomeAssistant.io is a neat platform for home automation, but the dashboard is not super friendly for users.
I'm old school. I beleive that users should be able to read, understand and modify web pages without needing to load up
14 different packages, 8 frameworks, and a specificially crafted IDE. (Not saying that the current node.js based front end
requires all that, but it might as well.)

This is my attempt to do just that.

No fancy frameworks, no bits of "clever" coding. just straight up modern javascript and CSS.
